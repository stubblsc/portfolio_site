Created both the front-end and back-end for a Ruby on Rails application for use by artists and photographers to be able to post their work and manage their pieces of art on a secure back-end protected by HTTP authentication. It also allows them to organize the pieces into different sections as well as organize the order of the pieces placed inside of those sections. I was personally responsible for the entirety of the project.
